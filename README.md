# MyAndroidScripts
Useful scripts for my android smartphone(HTC One M9)

## APM - Advanced Power Management
  Currently just a script that adjusts cpu and gpu stats based on thermals, a substitute for the default Power Manager service. 
  More to come.
  
## Script ideas:
  Automatic night color balancing to remove blue light(have a prototype, but it breaks easily)
  
  Dynamic CPU control based on usage(prototype works, but it's inefficient. I might see about making this a custom governor, that could take a while)
